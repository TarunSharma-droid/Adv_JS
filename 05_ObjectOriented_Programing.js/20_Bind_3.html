    // Simulating event listener
    const button = document.querySelector("button")
    
    // 1 } ðŸ’  button.addEventListener("click", app.showTitle())  => wrong syntax 

    // app.showTitle(), which means the function is called immediately,
    // means the function runs as soon as the script loads, NOT when the button is clicked.
 
    // 2 } ðŸ’  button.addEventListener("click", app.showTitle)    => wrong syntax
 
   // This is not working as expected because we are just passing the function definition.
   // When we pass a function definition (like app.showTitle), `this` is not set at that moment.
   // Later, when the button is clicked, here specially "this" does not remain not set.
   // JavaScript set "this" to the <button> ..
   // It is by default nature of JS that for DOM elements, JS sets the "this" to the element igniting it.

   // So inside showTitle, `this` refers to the button, and since the button has no `title` property,
   // `this.title` becomes undefined.

   // Chahe this set ho he na ya <button> ko refer kare dono he case mai kam nhi hoga

    // Use bind() to explicitly set "this" to "app" as to overwrite the browser act of setting "this" to "button".

    button.addEventListener("click", app.showTitle.bind(app))
