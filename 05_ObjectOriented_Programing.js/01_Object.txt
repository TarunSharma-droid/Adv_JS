++++++++++++++++++++++++  Object in JS +++++++++++++++++++++++++

 In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs,
 like a container that stores related data and functionalities.

++++++++++++++++++++++++  Object Literal +++++++++++++++++++++++++

An object literal is the simplest way to create an object â€” just use curly braces {} with keys and values.

Example : 

let car = {
  brand: "Toyota",
  model: "Camry",
  year: 2020
};

++++++++++++++++++++++ Object Constructor ++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An object constructor is a function used as a template to create many objects with the same structure but different data.

Example:

function Person(name, age) {  ==> This is a constructor function. You can use it like this:
  this.Full_name = name;
  this.Current_age = age;
}

let p1 = new Person("Tarun", 22);
let p2 = new Person("Raunak", 23);

Every time you do new Person(...), you get a new object.
