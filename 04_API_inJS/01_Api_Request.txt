API stands for ==> Application Programming Interface.

Imagine this:
You're at a restaurant.
You sit at a table, and you want to order food.
But you donâ€™t go to the kitchen yourself.
Instead, you give your order to a waiter.

Thatâ€™s exactly what an API does.

--> 
ðŸ”¹Browser (Webpage)     ==>	   You at the table
ðŸ”¹Server	            ==>    Kitchen
ðŸ”¹API                   ==>	   the menu of all the possible dishes ( whatâ€™s available ) and how to request it â€” the format, structure, and rules.
ðŸ”¹API Endpoint	        ==>    Selecting which dish you want.
ðŸ”¹XMLHttpRequest	    ==>    Waiter (middleman) 
                                    Writes it down on his notepad â€” this is like           waiter.open(). // Api call preaparation
                                    Goes to the kitchen and tells the chefs â€” this is like waiter.send(). // Api call
                                    Waits for the food to be ready â€”                       waiter.onload.
                                    Brings it back to your table and serves it â€”           waiter.responseText.
ðŸ”¹Response	            ==>   Waiter brings back your food

So XMLHttpRequest/fetch is the tool(waiter) that takes your order (API Call) to the kitchen (server) and brings back the data (response) â€” without 
making you move or refresh your table.
