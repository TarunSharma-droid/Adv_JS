<!--
API stands for ==> Application Programming Interface.

Imagine this:
You're at a restaurant.
You sit at a table, and you want to order food.
But you don’t go to the kitchen yourself.
Instead, you give your order to a waiter.

The menu = list of things you can ask for.
The waiter = API.
The kitchen = the system that prepares what you want.
You = the user or another program.

So…

You → give order to waiter (API)
Waiter → gives it to kitchen (System)
Kitchen → prepares food and gives it to waiter
Waiter → brings it back to you

That’s exactly what an API does.

In Computers:
Your code or app (you) wants data or a service.
The API sends that request to another system (like a server or database).
The system responds, and the API brings back the data for you to use.
